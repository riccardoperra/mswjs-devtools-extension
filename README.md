## ðŸš§ This project is currently in early development ðŸš§

## Usage

```ts
import {setupWorker, SetupWorkerApi} from "msw";
import {handlers} from "./handlers";

export const worker = setupWorker(...handlers);

declare global {
  interface Window {
    __MSWJS_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION: {
      configure: (msw: SetupWorkerApi) => void;
    };
  }
}

if (window.__MSWJS_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION) {
  window.__MSWJS_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION.configure(worker);
}
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add handler CRUD
- [ ] Add scenarios
- [ ] Add Import/Export configuration
- [ ] Add configuration persistence 
- [ ] Add request conditions from UI
- [ ] Import interfaces from open-api 
- [ ] Handle mock environments 
- [ ] Add docs
- [ ] Remove tailwind

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely
be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
